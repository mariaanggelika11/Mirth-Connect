# Changelog

## Unreleased — production hardening V2

Memory-only UI access tokens and rotating HttpOnly refresh sessions; CSRF and family revocation; keyed encryption and controlled rotation; safe metadata logs and redacted/raw permission; optional scoped HTTP idempotency; encrypted channel draft/publish/rollback; channel profile/dry-run; dead-letter reconciliation; lease owner fencing; persisted circuit/concurrency controls; protected metrics and initial webhook alert; safe encrypted disposable restore tooling; CI/security/container configuration and runbooks.

Safety behavior changes: channel PUT saves a draft; publish activates it. DELETE refuses retained revision history. Browser sessions from localStorage require fresh login. Default automatic retention is disabled. Ambiguous timeout/ACK goes to dead letter. Production plaintext MLLP requires an explicit isolated-network exception; verified PostgreSQL TLS remains mandatory. Review README and ADR before upgrading.
